# Snowflake Compatibility Review

## Overview
This document outlines the review of backend services, API integrations, and database connections for compatibility with Snowflake.

## 1. Snowflake Connection
- The `SnowflakeConnection` class in `utils/snow_connect.py` is correctly set up to read connection parameters from environment variables and establish a session with Snowflake.
- Ensure that the secrets used in `st.secrets` are correctly configured in the Streamlit application.

## 2. DDL Loading
- The `Snowddl` class in `utils/snowddl.py` loads DDL files for various tables. Ensure that the SQL syntax in the DDL files is compatible with Snowflake.
- Review the following DDL files:
  - `sql/ddl_transactions.sql`
  - `sql/ddl_orders.sql`
  - `sql/ddl_payments.sql`
  - `sql/ddl_products.sql`
  - `sql/ddl_customer.sql`

## 3. Template Adjustments
- The templates in `template.py` are designed to generate SQL queries. Ensure that the generated SQL adheres to Snowflake's SQL syntax.
- Review the following templates:
  - `TEMPLATE`
  - `LLAMA_TEMPLATE`

## Recommendations
- Conduct a thorough review of the SQL syntax in the DDL files to ensure compatibility with Snowflake.
- Test the generated SQL queries from the templates to confirm they execute correctly in the Snowflake environment.
